I included in my design choices a very basic color palette with black, white, and yellow. I wanted this to feel kind of eerie. It was a random game based off of a style of game called an ARG. 
I used a SCSS file and was able to utilize the Variables and Mixins
Variables: Fonts and Color;  I chose these variables because I wanted to keep these the same through the whole thing and I knew I was going to be going to be using these a lot
Mixins: Backgrounds and Links; this was a very powerful tool in helping to keep the code easy to read with these type of styles I was going to be using a lot.
